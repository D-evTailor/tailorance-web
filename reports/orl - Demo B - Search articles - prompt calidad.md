Goldschagg",2023,25,"Questions remain concerning treatment efficacy for the common condition of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). To compare the effectiveness of the Semont-plus maneuver (SM-plus) and the Epley maneuver (EM) for treatment of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (pcBPPV) canalolithiasis. This prospective randomized clinical trial was performed at 3 national referral centers (in Munich, Germany; Siena, Italy; and Bruges, Belgium) over 2 years, with a follow-up to 4 weeks after the initial examination. Recruitment took place from June 1, 2020, until March 10, 2022. Patients were selected randomly during routine outpatient care after being referred to 1 of the 3 centers. Two hundred fifty-three patients were assessed for eligibility. After consideration of the exclusion criteria as well as informed consent, 56 patients were excluded and 2 declined to participate, with 195 participants included in the final analysis. The analysis was prespecified and per-protocol. After being randomized to the SM-plus or the EM group, patients received 1 initial maneuver from a physician, then subsequently performed self-maneuvers at home 3 times in the morning, 3 times at noon, and 3 times in the evening. Patients had to document whether they could provoke positional vertigo every morning. The primary end point was the number of days until no positional vertigo could be induced on 3 consecutive mornings. The secondary end point was the effect of the single maneuver performed by the physician. Of the 195 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 62.6 (13.9) years, and 125 (64.1%) were women. The mean (SD) time until no positional vertigo attacks could be induced in the SM-plus group was 2.0 (1.6) days (median, 1 [range, 1-8] day; 95% CI, 1.64-2.28 days); in the EM group, 3.3 (3.6) days (median, 2 [range, 1-20] days; 95% CI, 2.62-4.06 days) (P = .01; α = .05, 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test). For the secondary end point (effect of a single maneuver), no significant difference was detected (67 of 98 [68.4%] vs 61 of 97 [62.9%]; P = .42; α = .05). No serious adverse event was detected with both maneuvers. Nineteen patients (19.6%) in the EM group and 24 (24.5%) in the SM-plus group experienced relevant nausea. The SM-plus self-maneuver is superior to the EM self-maneuver in terms of the number of days until recovery in pcBPPV.

 Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in older adults. Due to the high incidence of BPPV in older adults presenting with falls, vestibular assessment, and diagnosis of BPPV and other vestibular disorders has become a recommendation in the World Guidelines for Falls Prevention. There has been a paucity of evidence in well conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate vitamin D for prevention of BPPV recurrence and its relation to falls and function.
 
 
 
 This is a Phase IIa single centre, placebo controlled, double blind RCT to evaluate vitamin D supplementation together with diet and Canalith Repositioning Procedure [Group A] or diet alone combined with CRP [Gorup B] can reduce recurrence rates of BPPV. Post hoc analyses were performed evaluating BPPV recurrence, falls and function.
 53 participants were recruited. 14 were vitamin D replete at baseline [Group C- diet alone], the remaining 39 were randomised into Groups A and B. Group A was associated with 0.75 fewer clinical BPPV recurrences per one person year (IRD -0.75, 95% CI -1.18 to −0.32, P = 0.035).
 
 
 
 Older adults in the study who suffered a fall during the 12 month follow up had lower Activities of Daily Living scores. They also had poorer Short Physical Performance Battery scores at baseline. Participants in Group A had better 5x sit to stand time compared to Group B even accounting for underlying frailty scores. 25% of participants who fell in the 12 month follow up reported fear of falling compared to 43% in those with no falls in the 12 month follow up.
 Vitamin D supplementation improved physical performance in 5xchair stand test.
 
 
 
 In this study population, more participants without an incident fall during follow up experience fear of falling, prompting further consideration into the complex concept that is fear of falling.

Muñuzuri, Andrés Soto-Varela",2025,1,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo, often effectively treated with standard canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs). However, approximately 12.5% of cases remain refractory, leading to persistent symptoms and increased healthcare burden. Variations in the anatomical orientation of the semicircular canals (SCCs) may explain the resistance to conventional maneuvers. This study explores a personalized medicine approach, utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on MRI reconstructions to tailor CRMs with the help of mechanical rotation chair according to individual inner ear anatomy. We conducted a randomized, multicenter, open-label study targeting patients with refractory posterior canal BPPV. Participants were allocated to either a control group (receiving repeated standard CRMs and Brandt-Daroff exercises) or an intervention group (receiving personalized CRMs based on CFD simulations derived from MRI scans). The intervention group's maneuvers were executed using a mechanical rotational chair designed for precise angulation. Primary outcomes included resolution of nystagmus and vertigo symptoms, while secondary outcomes measured the reduction in healthcare visits and improved quality of life (Dizziness Handicap Inventory score). Personalized CRMs based on CFD models may enhance treatment efficacy for refractory BPPV by optimizing maneuver angles according to the specific SCC orientation. This approach could significantly reduce symptom persistence, decrease the need for repeated healthcare visits, and improve patient outcomes. The use of non-invasive MRI and CFD techniques represents a novel step toward individualized treatment in vestibular disorders, with potential for broader application in personalized otoneurology. Further analysis will determine the extent of clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of this approach.

This randomized, controlled, parallel-group, double-blind trial took place in multiple referral-based university hospitals in South Korea between July 2017 and February 2020. Of 728 patients (age ≥20 years) with diagnosed and treated BPPV, 585 were enrolled after excluding 143 who declined participation, could not use the internet, or had spinal problems, multicanal BPPV, or cognitive dysfunction. Patients were followed up for recurrence at least for 2 years until February 2022. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the treatment or control group. The patients in the treatment group completed a questionnaire for diagnosis and received a video clip for self-administration of canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM) according to the type of BPPV diagnosed when they experienced positional vertigo again. Patients in the control group received a video clip for self-administration of CRM according to the type of BPPV that had been diagnosed on enrollment. The primary outcome was self-reported resolution of positional vertigo post-CRM. Secondary outcomes included difficulties and requirement for assistance when using the program and any falls or other adverse events related to CRM.

"A Prospective Observational Study on the Efficacy of Epley’s Maneuver versus Universal Repositioning Maneuver in Managing Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo","The Epley maneuver is more effective in reducing nystagmus intensity, tolerability, balance, and nausea than the universal repositioning maneuver for managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.","Gupta Abhay Kumar, Lavania Ajay",2025,0,"
 
 The most prevalent cause of peripheral vertigo is Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which results from the displacement of free-floating otoconia within the semicircular canals. This displacement induces transient episodes of vertigo and nystagmus. This study evaluates and compares the efficacy of the Epley and Universal repositioning maneuvers in managing BPPV arising due to posterior semicircular canal pathlogy. Outcome measures were the reduction of nystagmus intensity, tolerability of induced dizziness, balance, and long-term efficacy.
 
 
 
 A prospective clinical study was conducted over a 2-year period at a tertiary hospital in Abu Dhabi, UAE, involving 100 patients. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to undergo either the Epley or Universal repositioning maneuver. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, to assess treatment outcomes.
 
 
 
 In a study assessing the efficacy of the Epley and Universal repositioning maneuvers in BPPV patients, 87 out of 100 showed symptomatic relief, including reduced dizziness intensity, nystagmus, and nausea, along with improved balance. Specifically, 88% (44 out of 50 patients) of those in the Epley group and 76% (38 out of 50 patients) in the universal repositioning group exhibited significant posttherapy improvement, although balance issues persisted in the latter. Follow-up assessments at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months indicated ongoing improvement in both groups. However, by 3-month follow-up, 20 patients in the universal repositioning group reported recurrence, suggesting a higher relapse rate. Two patients in the Epley maneuver and 4 patients in the universal repositioning maneuver lost to follow-up.
 
 
 
 The Epley maneuver was significantly more efficacious in reducing nystagmus intensity tolerability, balance, and nausea and appears to offer more sustained symptom relief with less recurrence compared to the universal repositioning maneuver. However, statistically, there was no significant difference between the two procedures.

"Immediate and short‐term effects of Gufoni and Appiani liberatory maneuver for treatment of ageotropic horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: A prospective randomized trial","The Appiani maneuver is more effective for immediate treatment of ageotropic horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo than the Gufoni maneuver, with spontaneous resolution occurring more frequently after follow-up.","Jiyeon Lee, Dong-Han Lee, Haemin Noh, J. Shin, Chang-Hee Kim",2021,9,"To examine the treatment effects of repositioning maneuvers with the head turned 45° downwards (Gufoni maneuver) and 45° upwards (Appiani maneuver) in 25 patients with ageotropic horizontal semicircular canal (HSCC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Patients were randomly assigned to the Gufoni or Appiani maneuvers, and their immediate and short-term efficacy was investigated. The immediate treatment response was successful in four of 16 patients who were treated with the Appiani maneuver and were not successful in any of the nine patients treated with the Gufoni maneuver. The patients who showed spontaneous resolution during follow-up outnumbered the patients who showed resolution of ageotropic HSCC BPPV immediately after the repositioning maneuvers. This study showed a very low immediate resolution rate of ageotropic HSCC BPPV after the Gufoni maneuver; this may be attributed to the less effectiveness of the Gufoni maneuver against debris that often exists in the canal side of the cupula. Another interesting finding was that the rate of spontaneous resolution during the follow-up period was higher than that of immediate resolution after the repositioning maneuvers, which may support the recently proposed hypothesis that ageotropic positional nystagmus can also be evoked by causes other than the otolithic attachment on the cupula, such as a slight change in the biochemical composition of the inner ear fluids. 3.","rct","Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology","2","10.1002/lio2.600","https://consensus.app/papers/immediate-and-short%E2%80%90term-effects-of-gufoni-and-appiani-lee-lee/518eed9c48a954f4a39fe79124b2dd97/"

A retrospective case-control study was conducted to evaluate the clinical data of 12,282 patients diagnosed with BPPV who received treatment at the Vertigo Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Research Center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, affiliated with Capital Medical University, between January 2020 and June 2024. Patients were categorized into an elderly group (≥65 years old) and a young-to-middle-aged group (<65 years old). Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and the interval from symptom onset to diagnosis were systematically compared and analyzed. The mean age of elderly BPPV patients was 71.2 ± 5.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1:2. The posterior semicircular canal was the most commonly affected site (62.3%) in elderly patients, and the incidence of horizontal semicircular canal canalolithiasis was higher in the elderly group compared to the young-to-middle-aged group (16.2% vs. 13.6%, < 0.001). The prevalence of arteriosclerosis-related risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart disease) was significantly higher ( < 0.001).

Çetin, A. Çağaç, U. Düzenli, N. Bozan, Sadi Elasan",2021,21,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Brandt-Daroff (BD) exercise and shopping exercise (SE) on the resolution of residual dizziness (RD) in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) following a successful modified Epley canalith repositioning maneuver (CRP). This single-blind, randomized clinical trial included patients with posterior semicircular canal type of BPPV. Following the modified Epley maneuver, patients that experienced RD were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (i) BD, (ii) SE, and (iii) control groups. Primary outcomes were quantified using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Following CRP, 240 (63%) participants experienced RD. All these patients were followed up weekly for RD. After the resolution of RD, patients were followed up monthly for recurrence. Mean time to recovery was 16.4 ± 10 (range, 5-49) days in the BD group, 11.5 ± 4.6 (range, 6-32) days in the SE group, and 23.4 ± 16.8 (range, 6-89) days in the control group. The SE group recovered significantly faster than the BD and control groups (p < 0.001). Baseline emotional DHI (E-DHI) scores were significantly correlated with the duration of pre-CRP symptoms (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis indicated that patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) recovered later than patients without these comorbidities. We found that RD improved significantly in the SE group compared to the BD and control groups. Additionally, a significant relationship was established between RD and high anxiety levels and DM, and obesity had a negative impact on the resolution of RD.","rct","ORL","3","10.1159/000516961","https://consensus.app/papers/residual-dizziness-in-elderly-patients-after-benign-%C3%A7etin-%C3%A7a%C4%9Fa%C3%A7/635933878a9c58acb638d5c53340d1a3/"

In addition to many factors affecting its treatment, aging is also thought to have an effect on treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the number of maneuvers applied in treatment and patient’s age, gender and the affected canal. Materials and Method: In total 290 subjects, between 18 to 87 years were included in the study. The positional tests were performed and the appropriate maneuver was performed based on affected canal. Following third day the maneuver positional tests were repeated. If the symptoms and / or nystagmus continued, maneuver was performed again. Results: It was found that older adults require higher number of maneuvers to recover (p<0.05, r= 0.33). In addition, comorbidities such as hypertension and migraine were observed more frequently in older adults compared to the other groups.

Khan",2023,4,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear disorder, characterized by brief episodes of vertigo caused by changes in head position. The condition can cause significant functional impairment and reduced quality of life. BPPV is especially common among diabetic patients. The Epley-canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) and vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) are two commonly used interventions for the treatment of BPPV. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Epley-canalith repositioning procedure (ECRP) and Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) therapy in the management of vertigo among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. A total of 30 subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged between 40 and 65 years, were randomly allocated to either the ECRP or VR therapy groups using a lottery method, and then underwent Epley-canalith repositioning procedure or vestibular rehabilitation therapy, respectively. The outcomes measured by the study were Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-sf) score and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score, assessed pre-treatment (pre) and 4 weeks post-treatment (post). The results demonstrated that both ECRP and VR therapy led to improvements in VSS-sf and BBS scores. However, VR therapy was found to be more effective, resulting in a 13.6% higher improvement in VSS-sf scores (= 0.03) and a 5.1% higher improvement in BBS scores (= 0.51) compared to ECRP. Both Epley-canalith repositioning procedure and vestibular rehabilitation therapy are effective in managing BPPV in diabetic patients. Although the differences in BBS scores are not statistically significant, VRT demonstrated a trend towards greater improvement. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy can be used by clinicians as another rehabilitation technique for improving vertigo, postural stability, and activity of daily living in diabetic patients with BPPV.","rct","Life","2","10.3390/life13051169","https://consensus.app/papers/effectiveness-of-epley%E2%80%93canalith-repositioning-shaphe-alshehri/3cf99fc6288153d595c16bca9c6aced5/"
"Comparing therapeutic maneuvers in posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","Epley's maneuver and Brandt-Daroff exercises are effective treatments for posterior semicircular canal BPPV, but combining the two maneuvers yields better symptomatic resolution and less recurrence.","R. Komathi, Karthik Ravi, M. Sivaranjani, M. Sharanya",2023,0,"Context: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo accounting for around 24% of all peripheral vestibular abnormalities and the posterior semicircular canal being the most affected. The most common cause of BPPV is idiopathic, others being inner ear disorders, trauma, infection, and increasing age. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of Epley's maneuver alone and Epley's maneuver with Brandt–Daroff exercises in the management of posterior semicircular canal BPPV, thereby comparing the recurrence rate after treatment in both groups. Materials and Methods: The study was a randomized prospective clinical trial with parallel and superiority trial design where 94 consecutive patients with posterior semicircular canal BPPV and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled into two Groups A = 47 and B = 47. All subjects underwent detailed history, examination, and assessment with UCLA dizziness questionnaire and videonystagmography. Group A patients received Epley's maneuver while group B received Epley's maneuver with Brandt–Daroff exercises as the treatment, with follow-up done on the 1st and 2nd weeks and after 1 month. Results: The age group of the majority of the patients in the study ranged between 51 and 60 years. The percentage of females in the study was 54.3% and males 45.7%. Results showed significant improvement in vertigo and nystagmus in both groups, with Group B having lesser recurrence during the follow-up visits. Conclusion: Both Epley's maneuver and Brandt–Daroff exercises are ideal means of treatment, but a combined approach of the two maneuvers yields better outcome in terms of symptomatic resolution and less recurrence.","rct","Indian Journal of Otology","3","10.4103/indianjotol.indianjotol_180_22","https://consensus.app/papers/comparing-therapeutic-maneuvers-in-posterior-canal-komathi-ravi/c1804e6ac5ae519398c7f5c3c1a30aa4/"
