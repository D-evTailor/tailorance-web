"Etiologic distribution of dizziness/vertigo in a neurological outpatient clinic according to the criteria of the international classification of vestibular disorders: a single-center study","Dizziness/vertigo is more common in females, often caused by damage to the vestibular system, with autoimmune inner ear disease being more prevalent in women and vascular vertigo/dizziness in men.","Yue Xing, Lihong Si, Wanting Zhang, Yuru Wang, Kangzhi Li, Xu Yang",2024,17,"The study aimed to determine the etiological characteristics of patients with dizziness/vertigo attending a neurological clinic according to the criteria of the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD), hoping to provide a valuable reference for clinicians to diagnose and treat dizziness/vertigo. A total of 638 consecutive patients with a chief complaint of dizziness/vertigo who attended the vertigo clinic of our neurology department from January 2019 to January 2020 were included. Clinical data of patients, including baseline data, medical history, neurological, neuro-otological, and auxiliary examination results were collected. The etiologic distribution of dizziness/vertigo was determined by analyzing the diagnoses of patients. Of the 638 patients with dizziness/vertigo, 38.8% were males, 61.2% were females, with a male: female ratio of 1:1.58 and a mean age of 52.9 ± 16.9 years. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was the most common cause of dizziness/vertigo in both female (38.9%) and male patients (25.5%). Subgroup analysis based on sex showed that vestibular migraine (VM) and probable autoimmune inner ear disease (p-AIED) were more prevalent in female patients (10.7% and 3.8%, respectively), while vascular vertigo/dizziness was more common in male patients (10.1%). Subgroup analysis based on age showed that the most common diseases were VM in patients aged 0-30 years (27.4%), BPPV in patients aged 31-60 years (27.1%) and 61-100 years (46.0%). Episodic vestibular syndrome (EVS) was the most commonly observed, accounting for up to 60.6% (389/638) of all patients, and the most common diagnoses were BPPV (55.3%, 215/389), VM (15.2%, 59/389), primary unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (p-UPVD) of unknown etiology (11.8%, 46/389), p-AIED (4.4%, 17/389), and vascular vertigo/dizziness (2.8%, 11/389) in these patients. Chronic vestibular syndrome (CVS) was found in 14.0% (90/638) of the patients, and the most common diagnoses were persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD, 35.6%, 32/90), psychogenic dizziness (18.9%, 17/90), p-UPVD of unknown etiology (15.6%, 14/90), vascular vertigo/dizziness (15.6%, 14/90), and bilateral vestibulopathy (7.8%, 7/90). Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) was observed in 8.4% (54/638) of the patients, and the most common diagnoses were p-UPVD of unknown etiology (31.5%, 17/54), vestibular neuritis (24.1%, 13/54), probable labyrinthine apoplexy (16.7%, 9/54), stroke (13.0%, 7/54), and psychogenic dizziness (11.1%, 6/54). 16.4% (105/638) of the patients were found to have other disorders, including 15.2% (16/105) of patients with internal diseases, and 84.8% (89/105) of patients with unknown causes. In terms of localization diagnosis, 56.1%, 17.0%, 10.0%, and 16.4% of the patients were diagnosed with peripheral vestibular disorder, central vestibular disorder, psychiatric and functional vestibular disorders, and other disorders, respectively. (1) Dizziness/vertigo was more common in females, which was frequently caused by damage to the vestibular system. Non-vestibular or unknown etiologies were also seen in some patients; (2) VM was more prevalent in women than in men, vascular vertigo/dizziness was more commonly observed in men; (3) EVS was more common in patients with dizziness/vertigo. The most common causes of dizziness/vertigo were peripheral vestibular disorders in patients with AVS and EVS, PPPD and psychogenic dizziness in patients with CVS. The most common causes were BPPV and p-UPVD of unknown etiology in patients with a peripheral vestibular disorder, VM and vascular vertigo/dizziness in patients with central vestibular disorder, PPPD and psychogenic dizziness in patients with psychiatric and functional vestibular disorders.","non-rct observational study","Journal of Neurology","1","10.1007/s00415-023-12166-3","https://consensus.app/papers/etiologic-distribution-of-dizzinessvertigo-in-a-xing-si/e609d7934977537abbba39b51a02bb6b/"
"Central vertigo","Recent advances in central vertigo highlight the need for an integrated approach to better understand its clinical features, laboratory findings, and limitations in current diagnostic tests for improved clinical practice.","Jeong-Yoon Choi, Seung-Han Lee, Ji-Soo Kim",2017,57,"This review considers recent advances in central vertigo in terms of clinical and laboratory features and pathophysiology. Strokes presenting dizziness-vertigo are more likely to be associated with a misdiagnosis in the emergency setting. The risk of future strokes after discharge is higher in patients diagnosed with peripheral vertigo than in control patients. Strokes and transient ischemic attacks account for one-quarter of acute transient vestibular syndrome. Diagnosis of acute combined central and peripheral vestibulopathy such as anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction requires additional consideration whenever applying the HINTS (head impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, and test of skew). Heat illness and metronidazole have been recognized as new causes of central vestibulopathy. Some new findings have also been added to the clinical and laboratory features of central vertigo. Central vertigo is a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse clinical spectrums. An integrated approach based on understanding of clinical features, laboratory findings, speculated mechanisms, and limitations of current diagnostic tests will lead to better clinical practice.","","Current Opinion in Neurology","1","10.1097/wco.0000000000000511","https://consensus.app/papers/central-vertigo-choi-lee/dd48b3ab250458bb824728fc0bb98d5b/"
"Epidemiology of Balance Symptoms and Disorders in the Community: A Systematic Review","Dizziness and vertigo are common in adults, but data on specific balance disorders like peripheral vestibular disorders is insufficient for informed service planning and clinical trials.","L. Murdin, A. Schilder",2015,187,"Balance disorders presenting with symptoms of dizziness or vertigo may have significant impact on quality of life and are a recognized risk factor for falls. The objective of this review was to systematically synthesize the published literature on the epidemiology of balance symptoms and disorders in the adult community population. A search was carried out across PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases to identify suitable studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they contained data on the epidemiology of symptoms of balance disorders (dizziness and vertigo) or balance disorders sampled from community-based adult populations. Data were collected on prevalence and incidence of balance symptoms and on specific balance disorders. A validated risk-of-bias assessment was carried out. Twenty eligible studies were identified. The lifetime prevalence estimates of significant dizziness ranged between 17 and 30%, and for vertigo between 3 and 10%. Published point prevalence data exist for Ménière's disease (0.12-0.5%) and for vestibular migraine (0.98%). For benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 1-year incidence estimates range from 0.06 to 0.6%. There are no community-based studies on the prevalence or incidence of chronic uncompensated peripheral vestibular disorders or vestibular neuritis. Symptoms of dizziness and vertigo are common in the adult population, and data give a coherent picture of community epidemiology. These data can inform rational service planning and much-needed clinical trials in this field. There are insufficient data on specific balance disorders, especially peripheral vestibular disorders such as vestibular neuritis and its long-term sequelae.","systematic review","Otology & Neurotology","1","10.1097/mao.0000000000000691","https://consensus.app/papers/epidemiology-of-balance-symptoms-and-disorders-in-the-murdin-schilder/528e3e8e4000520499ae5a7458c1b7ef/"
"Vertigo in the Elderly: A Systematic Literature Review","Vertigo in the elderly is most frequently caused by audio-vestibular disorders, followed by cardiovascular and neurological diseases.","V. Fancello, S. Hatzopoulos, G. Santopietro, G. Fancello, S. Palma, P. Skarżyński, C. Bianchini, A. Ciorba",2023,18,"Dizziness and vertigo are among the most prevalent complaints in the elderly and have a major negative influence on (i) the perception of the quality of life; and (ii) the risk of falling. Due to population aging, particularly in wealthy nations, vertigo represents a growing issue and a serious public health concern. In order to approach the patient correctly and to offer the best treatment options, it is mandatory to identify vertigo's underlying causes. The aim of this paper was to identify the different etiologies of vertigo and possibly their frequency in the elderly population, by reviewing the scientific literature of the last decade (2012-2022).A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, searching the Medline database from January 2012 through to December 2022. The search identified 1025 candidate papers, but after the application of specific selection criteria, only five were considered for further analysis.A total of 2148 elderly patients (60-90 y old) presenting with vertigo were reported in the selected papers. A total of 3404 conditions were identified as the cause of vertiginous symptoms, (some patients presented multiple etiologies). All major diagnoses were categorized into different subgroups: the most common origin of vertigo was represented by audio-vestibular disorders (28.4%), followed by cardiovascular (20.4%) and neurological diseases (15.1%). Furthermore, 9.1% of patients were diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, whilst ophthalmologic and musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 7.5% and 6.3% of the cases respectively. Medication adverse effects and metabolic-related diseases were also considered among the causes. For 3.4% of cases the etiology remains unclear. Conclusions: Audio-vestibular disorders represent the most frequent cause of vertigo in the elderly. The etiologies affecting the vertigo patient must be defined in order to identify potential life-threatening conditions, such as cardiovascular and neurological disorders, which according to the data of this review constitute the second and third common causes of vertigo. A multidisciplinary strategy, involving different specialists (such as ENTs, Neurologists, Cardiologists, Geriatricians) is recommended for the correct assessment of these disorders.","systematic review","Journal of Clinical Medicine","1","10.3390/jcm12062182","https://consensus.app/papers/vertigo-in-the-elderly-a-systematic-literature-review-fancello-hatzopoulos/2be034efca2150a49462e641edfe2fe2/"
"Vertigo and dizziness in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders: an international cross-sectional study","Vertigo is highly prevalent but underdiagnosed in individuals with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders, and may be an intrinsic component of these disorders, potentially exacerbated by early vestibular dysfunction.","Christophe Lopez, Pauline Burger, Jean-Louis Mandel, Romain Coutelle",2025,0,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with a genetic basis are frequently associated with neurological and sensory impairments; yet vestibular symptoms remain underrecognized. Vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance can significantly impact daily functioning, but their prevalence and genetic associations in individuals with NDDs are poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the occurrence of vestibular symptoms in individuals with genetic NDDs. We conducted an international, prospective cross-sectional study using data from the GenIDA database, which includes individuals with confirmed genetic disorders, intellectual developmental disorders and/or other NDDs. Caregivers completed a survey assessing the occurrence of vertigo, dizziness, and balance issues, as well as emotional distress, psychiatric comorbidities, and associated conditions such as migraine and epilepsy. We analyzed the prevalence of vertigo in the past 12 months and explored potential genetic contributors. The occurrence rate of vertigo (11.8%) and imbalance (27.7%) in the past 12 months was dramatically increased in individuals with genetic NDDs compared to that observed in the general population. However, less than 40% of patients had received a formal diagnosis for their vertigo. Notably, vertigo was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of feeling unhappy and depressed. Twenty genetic anomalies causally involved in NDDs were identified as potential contributors to vertigo, including 22q11.2 microdeletions and variants in ANKRD11, MED13L, PACS1 and SHANK3. Vertigo appears highly prevalent, yet underdiagnosed, in individuals with genetic NDDs. The identified genetic anomalies suggest that (1) vertigo may be an intrinsic component of NDDs, reflecting shared genetic pathways leading to inner ear malformations, vestibular network dysfunction, cerebellar abnormalities, and epilepsy, alongside other neurodevelopmental features; and/or (2) early vestibular dysfunction may exacerbate neurodevelopmental impairments.","non-rct observational study","Journal of Neurology","1","10.1007/s00415-025-13237-3","https://consensus.app/papers/vertigo-and-dizziness-in-genetic-neurodevelopmental-lopez-burger/c62acfbbf7745948948f1c7626be1046/"

The classification includes vertigo/dizziness due to stroke or transient ischemic attack as well as isolated labyrinthine infarction/hemorrhage, and vertebral artery compression syndrome. Vertigo and dizziness are among the most common symptoms of posterior circulation strokes. Vascular vertigo/dizziness may be acute and prolonged (≥24 hours) or transient (minutes to  < 24 hours). Vascular vertigo/dizziness should be considered in patients who present with acute vestibular symptoms and additional central neurological symptoms and signs, including central HINTS signs (normal head-impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, or pronounced skew deviation), particularly in the presence of vascular risk factors. Isolated labyrinthine infarction does not have a confirmatory test, but should be considered in individuals at increased risk of stroke and can be presumed in cases of acute unilateral vestibular loss if accompanied or followed within 30 days by an ischemic stroke in the anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. For diagnosis of vertebral artery compression syndrome, typical symptoms and signs in combination with imaging or sonographic documentation of vascular compromise are required.","","Journal of Vestibular Research","1","10.3233/ves-210169","https://consensus.app/papers/vascular-vertigo-and-dizziness-diagnostic-criteria-kim-newman-toker/6174622379715a9694f013136e6a6d03/"

"Acute vertigo: stroke or not?","A structured bedside approach focusing on key clinical features and targeted examination can improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce delays in appropriate treatment for acute vertigo, potentially improving patient outcomes.","D. Kaski",2025,0,"Acute vertigo accounts for about 4% of emergency department visits in both the United States and Europe. Despite this frequency, the management of dizziness, vertigo, and balance disorders remains fragmented, with no established international care pathway. The acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is particularly challenging, and timely recognition is essential to avoid potentially devastating outcomes. This review is timely, because misdiagnosis rates remain unacceptably high, especially for posterior circulation strokes presenting with dizziness. The literature highlights a wide differential diagnosis for AVS, ranging from benign peripheral vestibular disorders to life-threatening central causes. Distinguishing stroke from peripheral disorder remains a key clinical dilemma, compounded by the limitations of early neuroimaging - MRI can yield false negatives within 48 h. Up to 35% of posterior circulation strokes with dizziness are initially missed, often by nonspecialists unfamiliar with targeted bedside tests. A structured bedside approach, focusing on key clinical features and targeted examination, can improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce delays in appropriate treatment. Incorporating such strategies into standard practice could address a major gap in acute neurology care and improve patient outcomes.","literature review","Current Opinion in Neurology","1","10.1097/wco.0000000000001444","https://consensus.app/papers/acute-vertigo-stroke-or-not-kaski/ee2d38f0ffd35c5f9e76783b0eabd7a8/"

Goadsby",2025,1,"We set out to examine detailed phenotypic data from our clinic for associations of vertigo in chronic migraine. Vertigo is a non-canonical, common symptom of migraine. Little is known about its associations with other symptoms within the migraine phenotype. There is significant methodological heterogeneity and therefore inadequate overall evidence about the potential differences in efficacy of any migraine treatments in patients with problematic vertigo associated with migraine, compared to those without vertigo. Enhancing understanding of migraine-related vertigo could help guide treatment and inform on mechanisms of vestibular migraine, a poorly understood diagnostic entity. Chronic migraine extended phenotypes of patients seen within the adult headache service at King's College Hospital Tertiary Headache Service between January 2014 and December 2021 (n = 589) were extracted from the first documented clinic consultation letter retrospectively. For those with information about vertigo (n = 562), potential associations of interest for the presence of vertigo (gender, allodynia, aura, photophobia, phonophobia and osmophobia, baseline headache frequency, number of premonitory symptoms, presence of cranial autonomic symptoms, and age) were analyzed using a regression model (IBM SPSS v 29). Missing data were excluded (final n = 435). The total sample size for analysis in the regression model was n = 435, after excluding missing data (n = 126) and outliers (n = 1).

"Oxford Textbook of Vertigo and Imbalance","This new edition of the Oxford Textbook of Vertigo and Imbalance provides a comprehensive approach to dizziness and balance disorders, covering both inner ear and brain-related conditions.","",2025,0,"
 In this new edition of this book a broad group of international specialists in dizziness, vertigo, and balance disorders has been gathered. Neurologists, otolaryngologists, general practitioners, audiologists, therapists, and paediatricians from more than 10 different countries have provided state-of-the-art chapters on all aspects of dizziness and balance disorders. Neuro-otology is a medical discipline where physiological basis and practical clinical aspects are closely linked and where borders between specialties such as neurology and otology are deliberately blurred. For this reason, the book discusses the causes and treatments of disorders causing dizziness and imbalance, paying equal attention to those emanating from the inner ear or the brain. Diseases causing vertigo and imbalance, such as migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Meniere’s disease, have been known for decades or centuries. The book deals with these extensively but not forgetting the newly defined conditions such as cerebellar vestibular disorders, including the cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome or CANVAS, and other genetically determined diseases. All chapters in the current edition have been updated, but new chapters have also been added, dealing specifically with problems in the elderly and in children and with vestibular surgery. This book is ideal for doctors and therapists looking for a comprehensive approach to the patient with dizziness and unsteadiness.","","","","10.1093/med/9780198834380.001.0001","https://consensus.app/papers/oxford-textbook-of-vertigo-and-imbalance/d104d0b5d036501a9754841eaa95b11a/"

The utilization of medical resources and the duration of hospital stay for this kind of symptom is high. Furthermore, the efficiency of brain imaging in the acute phase is low, considering the limited sensitivity of both CT and MRI for diagnosing diseases that are the causes of central type of vertigo. Relying on imaging tests can provide false reassurance in the event of negative results or prolong the in-hospital work-up improperly. On the other hand, clinical examinations, notably the assessment of nystagmus' features, have proven to be highly accurate and efficient when performed by experts. Literature data point out that emergency physicians often do not employ these skills or use them incorrectly. Several clinical algorithms have been introduced in recent years with the aim of enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physicians when evaluating this specific pathology. Both the 'HINTS and 'STANDING' algorithms have undergone external validation in emergency physician hands, showing good diagnostic accuracy.

The GHS is a population-based cohort study representative of the city of Mainz and its district. Participants were asked whether they suffered from vertigo and, if so, how bothered they felt by it, rating their distress on a six-level scale from 1 = little stressful to 6 = extremely stressful. Eight thousand five hundred and nineteen participants could be included in the study. The overall prevalence of vertigo was 21.6% (95%-confidence interval [CI] [20.7%; 22.5%]). Vertigo prevalence peaked in the age group of 55-64 years. Vertigo annoyance averaged 2.42 (1.28). When an annoyance of 3-6 was considered bothersome, the prevalence of bothersome vertigo was 8.1 % (95%-CI [7.5%; 8.7%]). Age-standardized to the European Standard Population 2013, vertigo caused a burden of 2102 years lived with disability per 100,000 population. In this study, it was found that one in five people suffer at least occasionally from vertigo. This result suggests a significant burden of disease. This burden is reported at the symptom level. Future studies are needed to attribute the burden to specific causes. 2.","non-rct observational study","Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology","2","10.1002/lio2.1169","https://consensus.app/papers/vertigo-and-its-burden-of-disease%E2%80%94results-from-a-hackenberg-o%E2%80%99brien/a4fd29315eea57e1b1746864ff068cdb/"
"Diagnosis and treatment of vertigo and dizziness","This paper provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care providers on diagnosis and treatment of vertigo and dizziness, emphasizing history taking and clinical neurotological examination.","A. Tarnutzer, H. Kerkeni, Suzie Diener, Roger Kalla, C. Candreia, Renato Piantanida, Raphaël Maire, Antje Welge-Lüssen, Joris Budweg, Andreas Zwergal, Julia Dlugaiczyk",2025,2,"Vertigo and dizziness belong to the most common leading symptoms in clinical practice. Their differential diagnosis, however, often imposes a challenge. This work aims to provide evidence-based and practice-oriented recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of vertigo and dizziness for primary care providers. The consensus statement of an interdisciplinary working group following a national survey among Swiss primary care physicians and neurotology specialists (neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists) is presented. The associated literature search in PubMed was conducted up to October 2024. Structured history taking and clinical neurotological examination form the basis for the differential diagnosis of the various acute (AVS), episodic (EVS), and chronic (CVS) vestibular syndromes (AVS: e.g., stroke or acute unilateral vestibulopathy; EVS: e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPPV], Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, vestibular paroxysmia; CVS: e.g., bilateral vestibulopathy, persistent postural perceptual dizziness). The present paper covers the following topics: i) ""red flags"" for a potentially dangerous cause in patients with acute vertigo/dizziness/gait and balance disorders; ii) essential clinical neurotological examination steps; iii) diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for posterior and lateral canal BPPV; iv) the most important therapeutic strategies for the vestibular syndromes named above; and v) the top 10 recommendations regarding history taking, diagnosis, and treatment of vertigo and dizziness in clinical practice. This review aims to serve as a clinical companion for physicians of all specialties dealing with the primary diagnosis and treatment of vertigo and dizziness.","literature review","Hno","3","10.1007/s00106-025-01599-z","https://consensus.app/papers/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vertigo-and-dizziness-tarnutzer-kerkeni/8ce9ee7b479b529e85bce64d23c7dd92/"
